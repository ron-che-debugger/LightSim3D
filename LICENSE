This project was developed by **Ronghan** in 2025 as a high-performance, GPU-accelerated raytracer that leverages CUDA and OpenGL interop. It implements advanced rendering techniques such as:

- **BVH Acceleration**: Efficiently traverses scene geometry with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy.
- **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)**: Realistic material modeling including diffuse, specular, and emissive components.
- **Direct Light Sampling & Monte Carlo Integration**: For robust global illumination and realistic lighting.
- **OBJ Importing & Environment Mapping**: Loads complex 3D models and utilizes environment spheres for lighting.

This modular project is designed for real-time rendering and experimentation with cutting-edge graphics algorithms. Contributions, feedback, and collaborations are welcome!
